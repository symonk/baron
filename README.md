## Baron

-----

`Baron` is an insanely difficult (by design) 2D Platformer written in `Golang`.  The aim of the game
is to attempt to defeat progressingly difficult boss encounters.  The game is written using the
`ebiten` game engine for go.  The game aims to be beatable but only when playing to perfection.
